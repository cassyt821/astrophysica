# astrophysica
This GitHub Repository is open for anyone on the Internet to use. 

I created this Repository to make, easily accessible, my personal quest to understanding how to create and implement simulations of astrophysics phenomena in Python. I will do my best to leave useful comments by lines of code that were not as intuitive for me, and resolve issues as they come along. I hope this will be a useful learning tool for anyone who stumbles across it.

While I created this Repository, I am still learning about GitHub, Python, and simulations as well, so constructive feedback is welcome.
